            <p style="font-family: Playwrite AU VIC, cursive; font-weight: 400;">Coffee Express was founded by Akshaya V, It says that <br>
                coffee is everything we need on a tiring day. Akshaya and her
                <br>team strongly believes that "You can't buy happiness, but you can buy coffee, and that's pretty
                close." <br>
                We have lots of varieties in Coffee and the best part is every flavour tastes way <br>
                better and it is kind of complicated to choose a flavour... <br>
                <br>
                But dont worry we got you covered! our team is supportive and we are recogzied for excellent customer service.
                <br>
